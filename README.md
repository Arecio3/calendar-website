# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Task

Make a 9-5 Calendar Website that actively highlights the current time in red, past time in beige, and the future time in navy blue.

If you would like to save your events you would just need to press the save button on the right so when you leave the page and come back, your event is still their, thanks to LocalStorage.

With moment we have an active clock on the main jumbotron that presents the current Month, Date, Year, and time in Hours and minutes.

Pictures provided in a IMG folder.

Here is a link to the live website.  https://arecio3.github.io/calendar-website/
